# Tunnel (building ðŸš§)

Tunnel is an self-hosted and open-source project that aims to provide a simple and easy to use tool for creating and managing http tunnels to your local network.

It works by creating a tunnel between your local network and a public server, so you can access your local network from anywhere.
